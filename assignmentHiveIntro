 Fetch date and temperature from temperature_data where zip code is greater than
   300000 and less than 399999.
create table temprature(tdate timestamp, pin int, tmp int) row format delimited fields terminated by ',' stored as textfile;

load local inpath '/home/jayant/Downloads/dataset_Session 14.txt' into table temprature;

select tdate and tmp from temprature where pin BETWEEN 300001, 399998;

 Calculate maximum temperature corresponding to every year from temperature_data
   table.
select MAX(tem) from temprature where (select Distinct year from temprature);

 Calculate maximum temperature from temperature_data table corresponding to those
   years which have at least 2 entries in the table.
select MAX(tmp) from temprature where count(year)>2;

 Create a view on the top of last query, name it temperature_data_vw.
create view temperature_data_vw as select MAX(tmp) from temprature where count(year)>2;
 
 Export contents from temperature_data_vw to a file in local file system, such that each
   file is '|' delimited.
create table temperature_data_vw row format delimited fields terminated by '|' as select * from temprature;
